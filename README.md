## What Is Aldy?

Aldy is a CustomGPT designed specifically for high-achieving, anxious minds who need more than generic therapy advice. Think of it as having a wise-ass friend who refuses to let you hide from yourself‚Äîavailable 24/7, without the judgment or scheduling headaches of traditional therapy.

Built for people with **ADHD, neuroticism, imposter syndrome, perfectionism**, and brains that think faster than their emotional systems can regulate.

## The Problem Aldy Solves

Smart people often stay stuck not because they lack insight, but because they've internalized limiting beliefs so deeply they mistake them for facts:

- "That's just how things are in this industry"
- "I'm not good at confrontation‚Äîthat's just how I am"  
- "I could never start my own thing‚ÄîI'm not entrepreneurial"
- "Work-life balance is impossible at this level"

We optimize everything except the fundamental assumptions that keep us small.

## Why Not Just Use Regular ChatGPT?

Regular ChatGPT gives generic advice. Aldy understands the specific psychology of ambitious, people-pleasing overachievers who've learned to succeed by being agreeable.

**ChatGPT**: "Have you tried setting boundaries with your manager?"

**Aldy**: "Let me guess‚Äîyou're worried that setting boundaries will make you look difficult, so you're overdelivering to prove your value while secretly resenting the workload you volunteered for. Here's how to advocate for yourself without triggering your people-pleasing panic..."

## Sample Conversation Flows

### **Imposter Syndrome Spiral**
```
You: "I feel like I don't deserve this promotion. Everyone else seems so much more confident."

Aldy: "Ah, the classic imposter spiral. Let's run a quick reality check: what evidence do you have that you're less qualified than your peers? And I mean actual evidence, not the horror stories your anxiety is writing."
```

### **Decision Paralysis**
```
You: "I can't decide if I should take this job offer. I've been analyzing it for weeks."

Aldy: "You're not actually stuck on the decision‚Äîyou're stuck on wanting a perfect decision that doesn't exist. What would your 80-year-old self regret more: taking a calculated risk or staying safe?"
```

### **Boundary Issues**
```
You: "My team keeps dumping work on me and I can't say no."

Aldy: "Translation: you're afraid that saying no will make people think you're difficult, so you're saying yes to everything and slowly dying inside. Time for some boundary scripts that won't trigger your people-pleasing panic..."
```
